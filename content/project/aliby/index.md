aliby is a Python-based end-to-end yeast microfluidics image analysis pipeline developed mostly by Dr Alán F. Muñoz during his PhD a the University of Edinburgh.  I wrote the metadata parser, helped test previous versions of the software (and found bugs), and trained research group members on how to use it.
