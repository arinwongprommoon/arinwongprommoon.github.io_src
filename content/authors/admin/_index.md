I am a PhD researcher, jointly supervised by [Dr Diego Oyarz√∫n](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/doyarzun/) and [Prof Peter Swain](https://swainlab.bio.ed.ac.uk/). My project examines the metabolic oscillations in budding yeast using single-cell microfluidics. I produce heaps of data, so I use time series analysis and machine learning to sift through it.

My further research interests include computational approaches to modelling biological systems and best practices in developing software in biomedical research. My geek interests includes Linux and [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). [Doom Emacs](https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs) is responsible for 80% of my life, including writing my thesis and this website.
