#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Meliodosis Genomic Lab at the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, Thailand. I study melioidosis, a neglected tropical disease endemic to Thailand and other regions of southeast Asia, caused by the environmental bacterium _Burkholderia pseudomallei_. My work aims to uncover how the bacterial genome and changes in human host transcription explains why melioidosis outcomes are very varied among patients in the northeast Thailand.
