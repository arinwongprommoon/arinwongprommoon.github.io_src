After two years online, I've just updated my website layout.

This really is a result of a cascade of events.  I had updated the Hugo version on the machine I use to prototype my page, but it broke the website (no thanks to Hugo's lack of backwards compatibility).  After exhausting other options, I decided to start over from a recent HugoBlox template that was closest to my original website, and copied over the content.

Thankfully I don't have that many pages.

Hopefully in two years' time, I have a better solution.
